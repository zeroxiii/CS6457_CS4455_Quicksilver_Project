- Viewing Requirements:
Start the game in the main menu.  Proceed to the NEW GAME door in front of character.  This will load the first level which is a tutorial level.  

For each level, you will see a variety of enemies and objects.  Here is what they do:

Enemies:
- Ninja Warrior (white):  Follows simple patrol path.  Chases player if he sees him.  Uses melee attacks to deal damage.  Has low health and low energy reward.  
- Regen Warrior (green):  Follows patrol network.  Chases player if he sees him.  Uses melee attacks to deal damage.  If killed, he will come back to life after a second and continue chasing the player.  He only gives energy reward after the first kill.  He has comparable health and energy to ninja warrior.  Best to evade after first kill.
- Ranged Warrior (blue):  Follows patrol above player.  Uses ranged attacks to deal damage to player.  Does severe damage.  Low health, high reward. 
- Brute Warrior (purple):  Large enemy that patrols.  Uses melee attacks to deal damage to player.  Does severe damage.  High health, high energy reward.

Objects:
- Crates: These crates are pushable by the player.
- Glass:  These walls are breakable if you dash through them while moving with a forward velocity.
- Bombs:  These objects explode if they are shot at by the player or the enemies.  The blast radius will hurt the player or the enemy.  These bombs also go off if the player touches them.
- Energy Packs:  These are floating batteries.  Touching them will give the player a reasonable boost of energy.

In the first level, the walls have instructions to new players to demonstrate the basic gameplay of the game.  Reach the end of the stage.  You should have enough energy to proceed to next stage.  If not, restart the level.  Select NEXT LEVEL to proceed to Level 2.

In Level 2, there are several enemies and interactable objects.  Explore and try to interact with everything as you try to reach the end of the level.  This level has one of each of the AI.  Try using a variety of slash attacks and shoot attacks to defeat them.  Or use the shield guard or shrink to avoid detection.  Collect batteries in the level for energy boosts.  Navigate to the end with enough energy to beat the stage.  The minimum amount energy you must have at the end of this stage is 60.  After winning, proceed to Level 3.

In Level 3, the difficulty is much higher. The goal is the same as previous levels, but there are more enemies. The ranged enemies here are stationary (if they weren't, the level would be too hard). Remember that dashing breaks glass and that bombs go off by shooting at them (or by moving into them, but you should avoid that because you take massive damage). Exploding bombs also destroy glass and hurt enemies. Use this to your advantage. The very end of the level faces you off against a beefed up giant enemy. Defeating him is optional but gives a lot of energy. The minimum amount energy you must have at the end of this stage is 50. Note there is an alternate route a player can take to reach the end of the level. This requires some clever movement on your initial jump down. (Hint: Try not the break the first pane of glass you see.) 

Upon completion of Level 3, selecting NEXT LEVEL will take you to the credits.  Exiting the credits or leaving them alone will take you back to the title screen.  Feel free to use Level Select to play any of the three stages.
